Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are deﬁned as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository1): 

**Data Set Information**

**Features**

|Feature|Description|
|-----|-----|
|CRIM|per capita crime rate by town|
|ZN|proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.|
|INDUS|proportion of non-retail business acres per town|

|AGE|proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940|
|DIS|weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers|
|RAD|index of accessibility to radial highways|
|TAX|full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars|
